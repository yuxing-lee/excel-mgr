# Excel Manager

This simple Flask application provides a web interface to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a local Excel file.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

The application automatically creates `data.xlsx` if it does not exist.
